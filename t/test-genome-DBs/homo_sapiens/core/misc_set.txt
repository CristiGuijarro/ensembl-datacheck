91	ABC	ABC libraries	Mapped clone end sequences from ABCs (ABC7, ABC8, ABC9, ABC10, ABC11, ABC12, ABC13, ABC14, ABC16, ABC21, ABC22, ABC24, ABC27) human fosmid libraries (ABC)	18047227
92	encode_excluded	ENCODE excluded regions	Genomic regions that have been identified as problematic in the human genome by the ENCODE project. These regions contain abnormally high unique-mapping read coverage signal in open chromatin and control/input datasets across many cell lines and are classified as dispersed high mappability artifacts, dispersed low mappability artifacts, satellite repeats, centromeric repeats, telomeric repeats or snRNA repeats.	4132352
93	tilepath	Tilepath	BAC clones upon which the current genomic assembly was based.  Colours indicate a finished sequence (gold clones), phase 1 sequencing (dark pink), phase 0 (light pink) or other (grey).  Clones that have been fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) mapped are marked with a black triangle in the top left corner.  If a clone is shown in outline, the mapping to the genome is problematic and the true length may not be displayed.	1071649
94	WIBR-2	WIBR-2 library	Mapped clone end sequences from WIBR-2 human fosmid library (WI2)	18043599
